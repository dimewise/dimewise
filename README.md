## Setting up the Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up the local environment for the DimeWise project:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    - Open your terminal.
    - Navigate to your desired directory.
    - Run the following command to clone the project:
      ```bash
      git clone [repository_url]
      ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    - Ensure that [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) is installed in your environment

    - Change into the root directory of the project:
      ```bash
      cd dimewise
      ```
    - Run bun install to install project dependencies:
      ```bash
      bun install
      ```

3.  **Setup pre-commit and pre-push hooks:**

    - Run bun run setup:hooks to set up git hooks:
      ```bash
      bun run setup:hooks
      ```

4.  **Copy Environment Variables:**

    - Locate the `env.example` file in the root directory.
    - Create a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`.

5.  **Start Supabase Local Server:**

    - Ensure that Prisma and Supabase CLI are installed (**optional**: this should already be done with `bun install`):
      ```bash
      bun add -g prisma
      bun add -g supabase
      ```
    - Start the Supabase local server using the following command:

      ```bash
      bunx supabase start
      ```

      Upon running the above command, it should show your supabase status information. Copy the values of `API URL` and `anon key` into the `.env` file created in step 4.

      **Note:** Ensure Docker is running, as this process requires it. If you lose the supabase status information, run `bunx supabase status` to display the information again.

6.  **Execute database migrations**:

    - Run the following command to apply database migrations:
      ```bash
      bunx prisma migrate dev
      ```

Now, your local environment is set up and ready for development with DimeWise!
