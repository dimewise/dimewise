# Road Map for Dimewise

General goal: Achieve MVP and deploy it for users to use as soon as possible

## What will be included in the MVP?

The general idea behind the MVP is to first encompass the idea of tracking expenses with a budget based off of category's budget.

1. Category functionality that has a budget assigned to them
2. Expense tracking that allows CRUD operations and tying an expense to a category
3. Analytics view of the expense, think graphical interface that can be interacted with
4. List/History of expenses in a single view

Something that have yet to be discussed, but there could be an opporunity to build it as a responsive web app but also allow it to be PWA such that users can download it as an app and put it on their phone if they so desire.

## What's next after the MVP?

This section is still up for discussion, however, we have discussed that nested categories is a feature that we would like to proceed with next. But let's first list down what we would like to have ideally from both shareholder's perspective.

Haru:

1. Nested categories that sums up to the parent category (must sum up)
2. OCR for receipt recognition
3. Ability to suggest new categories based on context

Luke:

1. Bill splitting capabilities
2. Opt-in end of month reporting

Ultimate Feature:

1. Gamification
   a. Saving goals (e.g. reached their saving goals, get a reward)
   b. Inter-group competition (e.g. who spent the less? sharing of category within group and compete against who spent the less?)

Somewhere far in the future:

1. Financial analysis

General Priorities of roadmap:

1. Nested categories
2. Gamification

As of current, our goals will be to reach MVP first before discussing further about what else we would like to add.
